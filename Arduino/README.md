#Learning with Ardunio

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects.

I recommend starting with the Adafruit lessons.
1) Start here: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-1-blink/loading-the-blink-example
2) Fast forward to the serial monitor project: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-5-the-serial-monitor/the-serial-monitor

During the coding club meeting on October 5 we used used an Arduino Uno with three [smart RGB NeoPixel](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1559])
This project is a mashup of the serial monitor project and this jack-o-candle project.
