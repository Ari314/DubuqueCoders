#Learning How to Code with Arduino

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects.   Learn more about the platform here: https://www.arduino.cc/

I recommend starting with the Adafruit lessons.

2) Fast forward to the serial monitor project: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-5-the-serial-monitor/the-serial-monitor

###Taco Shell Box IoT (Internet of Thingies)
During the coding club meeting on October 5 we used used an Arduino Uno with three [smart RGB NeoPixel](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1559)
The code used is in the [jack-o-candle2 folder](https://github.com/DubuqueSeniorCS/DubuqueCoders/tree/master/Arduino/jack-o-candle2).  This software is a mashup of the [serial monitor project](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-5-the-serial-monitor/the-serial-monitor) and a [jack-o-candle project](https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixel-jack-o-lantern/).

We connected the Arduino to a Raspberry Pi running Node-Red and wired up a flow to interact with the serial commands.
