# DubuqueCoders
Dubuque Senior Coding Club information 

The "Wiki" tab on the top has different information. Right now, it contains a couple things. 

1. The coding challege Aaron has desgined. 
2. Awesome learning games that Drew provided :) 
3. Some links to get started with node.js. 

Next we are going to learn about node red. If you have a computer and want to learn about it....go for it. The only installation instructions use the command line, so if you are using windows, you want to install gitbash for windows. It is an easy to use command line 
interface. (just like we used with PuTTY on the second night and like the cloud9 linux terminal) 

Can't wait to see what you have created for next week!
